SOLID Principles

## Description

This repository was created for personal learning regarding the SOLID design principles of software engineering

### S => Single Responsibility Principle

* A class should have a single responsibility
* A class should be simple to understand and not be complex in its meaning
* A class should have only one job to do i.e. be a single actor

### O => Open Closed Principle

* Classes/Interfaces etc. should be open for extension but closed for modification
* There should be utilisation of abstract interfaces as a base
* Classes should extend features from the base abstract class
