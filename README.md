SOLID Principles

## Description

This repository was created for personal learning regarding the SOLID design principles of software engineering

### S => Single Responsibility Principle

* A class should have a single responsibility
* A class should be simple to understand and not be complex in its meaning
* A class should have only one job to do i.e. be a single actor

### O => Open Closed Principle

* Classes/Interfaces etc. should be open for extension but closed for modification
* There should be utilisation of abstract interfaces as a base
* Classes should extend features from the base abstract class

### L => Liskov Substitution Principle

* Objects in a program should be replaceable with their subtypes without altering program correctness
* Base class replaced by their sub type should not change functionality of a program
* Extensible rule of the Open Closed Principle

### I => Interface Segregation Principle

* Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface
* Implement interfaces that have purpose and meaning
* Code should not be forced to implement methods that it will not use

### D => Dependency Inversion Principle

* A software entity should depend on abstractions, not concretions
* Details should depend on abstractions, abstractions should NOT depend on details
* High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules
